    <div>Meat production is a leading cause of climate change, experts say, and the growing demand for pork and beef in China has fueled much of that environmental damage, from water shortages and heat waves to deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.</div>
    <div>According to the National Bureau of Statistics, average meat consumption per person in China in 2017 is 26.7 kilograms. In the same year, the data provided by statistica.com for the US is 98.4 kg, 3.6 times that of China.</div>
    <div>And the data for European countries ranges between 70 to 90 kg. Even in the Republic of Korea, where people often jokingly complain they cannot afford meat, the meat consumption per year is 42.7 kg per person in as early as 2013.</div>
    <div>Land, irrigation water, greenhouse gas, and reactive nitrogen burdens of meat, eggs, and dairy production in the United States</div>
    <div>So who is causing the "little puffs" in the Amazon, if there are any?</div>
    <div>China has been doing its part to make the world greener. On Sept 19, 2019, Alipay's Ant Forest program won the UN Champions of the Earth award for helping 500 million people adjust to low-carbon lifestyles, and planted 122 million trees.</div>
    <div>And a NASA report released in February 2019, finds China's total green area had grown 17.8 percent from 2000 to 2017, with runner-up India showing 11.1 percent of growth. China is the champion in making the world greener.</div>
    <div>We Chinese have always contributed to the fight against climate change, and we are glad to contribute more. However, it is totally wrong and absurd to blame us for having caused it.</div>
